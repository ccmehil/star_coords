# Star Coordinates

Get the AltAz coordinates for a given object using astropy and output on a OLED screen.

As a very very newcomer to the astronomy scene and living in a area with a bit higher light pollution I find it's necessary to get the AltAz coordinates for an object to help me find it.

My understanding is the the Alt is a degree point ona 360 degree circle where 0 is True North. and Az is a degree of elevation or tilt the telescope has within a range of -90 to 90 degrees. Where as other from 0 to 90 is visible, although based on my elevation anything from 30 to 90 is more likely.
